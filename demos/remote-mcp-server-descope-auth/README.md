# Remote MCP Server with Descope Auth

Let's get a Remote MCP server up-and-running on Cloudflare Workers with Descope OAuth login!

> [!WARNING]
> This is a demo template designed to help you get started quickly. While we have implemented several security controls, **you must implement all preventive and defense-in-depth security measures before deploying to production**. Please review our comprehensive security guide: [Securing MCP Servers](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/blob/main/docs/securing-mcp-servers.md)

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- A [Descope](https://www.descope.com/) account and project
- Node.js version `18.x` or higher
- A Cloudflare account (for deployment)

## Develop locally

1. Get your credentials from the Descope Console:
   - [Project ID](https://app.descope.com/settings/project)
   - [Management Key](https://app.descope.com/settings/company/managementkeys)

2. Create a KV namespace for OAuth state storage:

```bash
npx wrangler kv namespace create OAUTH_KV
# Copy the ID and update wrangler.jsonc
```

3. Copy the `.dev.vars.example` file to `.dev.vars` and fill in your credentials:

```bash
# .dev.vars
DESCOPE_PROJECT_ID="your_project_id"
DESCOPE_MANAGEMENT_KEY="your_management_key"
COOKIE_ENCRYPTION_KEY="your_cookie_encryption_key"
```

Generate the cookie encryption key:
```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
```

4. Clone and set up the repository:

```bash
# clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:cloudflare/ai.git

# install dependencies
cd ai
npm install

# run locally
npx nx dev remote-mcp-server-descope-auth
```

You should be able to open [`http://localhost:8787/`](http://localhost:8787/) in your browser

## Connect the MCP inspector to your server

To explore your new MCP api, you can use the [MCP Inspector](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/inspector).

1. Start it with `npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector`
2. [Within the inspector](http://localhost:5173), switch the Transport Type to `SSE` and enter `http://localhost:8787/sse` as the URL of the MCP server to connect to.
3. Add a bearer token and click "Connect"
4. Click "List Tools"
5. Run the "getToken" tool, which should return the Authorization header that you set in the inspector

## Deploy to Cloudflare

1. Create a KV namespace for production:

```bash
npx wrangler kv:namespace create OAUTH_KV --env production
# Update the KV namespace ID in wrangler.jsonc
```

2. Set up your secrets in Cloudflare:

```bash
# Set Descope credentials as secrets
npx wrangler secret put DESCOPE_PROJECT_ID
npx wrangler secret put DESCOPE_MANAGEMENT_KEY
npx wrangler secret put COOKIE_ENCRYPTION_KEY
```

3. Deploy the worker:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

## Call your newly deployed remote MCP server from a remote MCP client

Just like you did above in "Develop locally", run the MCP inspector:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector@latest
```

Then enter the `workers.dev` URL (ex: `worker-name.account-name.workers.dev/sse`) of your Worker in the inspector as the URL of the MCP server to connect to, and click "Connect".

You've now connected to your MCP server from a remote MCP client. You can pass in a bearer token like mentioned above.

## Features

The MCP server implementation includes:

- üîê OAuth 2.0/2.1 Authorization Server Metadata (RFC 8414)
- üîë Dynamic Client Registration (RFC 7591)
- üîí PKCE Support
- üìù Bearer Token Authentication
