This is a [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) server that supports remote MCP connections, with [Clerk](http://clerk.com/) OAuth for your instance built-in.

You can deploy it to your own Cloudflare account, and after you create your own Clerk OAuth client app for your instance, you'll have a fully functional remote MCP server that you can build off. Users will be able to connect to your MCP server by signing in with their account on your Clerk instance.

You can use this as a reference example for how to integrate other OAuth providers with an MCP server deployed to Cloudflare, using the [`workers-oauth-provider` library](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider).

The MCP server (powered by [Cloudflare Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/)): 

* Acts as OAuth _Server_ to your MCP clients
* Acts as OAuth _Client_ to your _real_ OAuth server (in this case, your Clerk instance)

## Getting Started

### For Production
Create a new [Clerk OAuth app](https://clerk.com/docs/advanced-usage/clerk-idp#create-a-clerk-o-auth-application) for your instance: 
- For the Redirect URI, specify `https://mcp-clerk-oauth.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev/callback`
- Note your Client ID and Client secret. 

#### Variables
- `CLERK_OAUTH_SCOPES`: Scopes that define the level of access for user data for your MCP server, comma delimeted - these can be set in `wrangler.jsonc` - [Clerk OAuth Scopes](https://clerk.com/docs/advanced-usage/clerk-idp#scopes)

#### Secrets
- `CLERK_APP_CLIENT_ID` Client ID for Clerk OAuth application
- `CLERK_APP_CLIENT_SECRET` Confidential secret for your Clerk OAuth application
- `CLERK_APP_URL`: The base URL for your Clerk auth instance ie. `pretty-clouds-11.clerk.accounts.dev`


- Set secrets via Wrangler
```bash
wrangler secret put CLERK_APP_CLIENT_ID
wrangler secret put CLERK_APP_CLIENT_SECRET
wrangler secret put CLERK_APP_URL
```

#### Set up a KV namespace
- Create the KV namespace: 
`wrangler kv namespace create "OAUTH_KV"`
- Update the Wrangler file with the KV ID

#### Deploy & Test
Deploy the MCP server to make it available on your workers.dev domain 
` wrangler deploy`

Test the remote server using [Inspector](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/inspector): 

```
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector@latest
```
Enter `https://mcp-clerk-oauth.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev/sse` and hit connect. Once you go through the authentication flow, you'll see the Tools working: 

<img width="640" alt="oauth-login" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c7142376-3668-4c25-befb-6010b1d3161f" />

You now have a remote MCP server deployed! 

#### Access the remote MCP server from Claude Desktop

Open Claude Desktop and navigate to Settings -> Developer -> Edit Config. This opens the configuration file that controls which MCP servers Claude can access.

Replace the content with the following configuration. Once you restart Claude Desktop, a browser window will open showing your OAuth login page. Complete the authentication flow to grant Claude access to your MCP server. After you grant access, the tools will become available for you to use. 

```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "math": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-remote",
        "https://mcp-clerk-oauth.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev/sse"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Once the Tools (under ðŸ”¨) show up in the interface, you can ask Claude to use them. For example: "Could you use the math tool to add 23 and 19?". Claude should invoke the tool and show the result generated by the MCP server.

### For Local Development
If you'd like to iterate and test your MCP server, you can do so in local development. This will require you to create another OAuth App on Clerk: 
- For the Redirect URI, specify `http://localhost:8788/callback`
- Note your Client ID and Client secret. 
- Create a `.dev.vars` file in your project root with: 
```
CLERK_APP_CLIENT_ID="your_clerk_app_client_id"
CLERK_APP_CLIENT_SECRET="your_clerk_app_client_secret"
CLERK_OAUTH_SCOPES="your_scopes_for_your_mcp_comma_delimeted"
CLERK_APP_URL="your_clerk_auth_application_url"
```

#### Develop & Test
Run the server locally to make it available at `http://localhost:8788`
`wrangler dev`

To test the local server, enter `http://localhost:8788/sse` into Inspector and hit connect. Once you follow the prompts, you'll be able to "List Tools". 

#### Using Claude and other MCP Clients

When using Claude to connect to your remote MCP server, you may see some error messages. This is because Claude Desktop doesn't yet support remote MCP servers, so it sometimes gets confused. To verify whether the MCP server is connected, hover over the ðŸ”¨ icon in the bottom right corner of Claude's interface. You should see your tools available there.

#### Using Cursor and other MCP Clients

To connect Cursor with your MCP server, choose `Type`: "Command" and in the `Command` field, combine the command and args fields into one (e.g. `npx mcp-remote https://<your-worker-name>.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev/sse`).

Note that while Cursor supports HTTP+SSE servers, it doesn't support authentication, so you still need to use `mcp-remote` (and to use a STDIO server, not an HTTP one).

You can connect your MCP server to other MCP clients like Windsurf by opening the client's configuration file, adding the same JSON that was used for the Claude setup, and restarting the MCP client.

## How does it work? 

#### OAuth Provider
The OAuth Provider library serves as a complete OAuth 2.1 server implementation for Cloudflare Workers. It handles the complexities of the OAuth flow, including token issuance, validation, and management. In this project, it plays the dual role of:

- Authenticating MCP clients that connect to your server
- Managing the connection to your Clerk instance's OAuth services
- Securely storing tokens and authentication state in KV storage

#### McpAgent
McpAgent extends the base MCP functionality with Cloudflare's Durable Objects, providing:
- Persistent state management for your MCP server
- Secure storage of authentication context between requests
- Access to authenticated user information via `this.props`
- Support for conditional tool availability based on user identity

#### MCP Remote
The MCP Remote library enables your server to expose tools that can be invoked by MCP clients like the Inspector. It:
- Defines the protocol for communication between clients and your server
- Provides a structured way to define tools
- Handles serialization and deserialization of requests and responses
- Maintains the Server-Sent Events (SSE) connection between clients and your server
