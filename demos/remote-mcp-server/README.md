# Remote MCP Server on Cloudflare

Let's get a remote MCP server up-and-running on Cloudflare Workers complete with OAuth login!

## Develop locally

```bash
# clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:cloudflare/ai.git

# navigate to this example
cd ai/demos/remote-mcp-server

# install dependencies
npm install

# run locally
npm run dev
```

You should be able to open [`http://localhost:8787/`](http://localhost:8787/) in your browser

## Connect the MCP inspector to your server

To explore your new MCP api, you can use the [MCP Inspector](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/inspector).

- Start it with `npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector`
- [Within the inspector](http://localhost:5173), switch the Transport Type to `SSE` and enter `http://localhost:8787/sse` as the URL of the MCP server to connect to, and click "Connect"

- You will navigate to a (mock) user/password login screen. Input any email and pass to login.

- You should be redirected back to the MCP Inspector and you can now list and call any defined tools!

## Connect Claude Desktop to your local server

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "math": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-remote",
        "http://localhost:8787/sse"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Deploy to Cloudflare

1. `npx wrangler@latest kv namespace create remote-mcp-server-oauth-kv`
2. Follow the guidance to add the kv namespace ID to `wrangler.jsonc`
3. `npm run deploy`

## Call your newly deployed remote MCP server from a remote MCP client

Just like you did above in "Develop locally", run the MCP inspector:

`npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector@latest`

Then enter the `workers.dev` URL (ex: `worker-name.account-name.workers.dev/sse`) of your Worker in the inspector as the URL of the MCP server to connect to, and click "Connect".

You've now connected to your MCP server from a remote MCP client.
